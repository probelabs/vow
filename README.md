> A sacred covenant between machine and man. Accountability gates for AI agents.

Vow ensures AI agents pause and honestly self-review before taking action. No shortcuts. No lies. No claiming completion without actual completion.

## ✨ Features

- 🛡️ **Accountability Gates** - AI must affirm checklist requirements before proceeding
- 📝 **Customizable Rules** - Override default vows with your own requirements
- 🔌 **Universal Integration** - Works with git hooks, Husky, Claude Code, and any trigger
- 🎯 **Zero Config** - Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- 🪶 **Lightweight** - 40 lines of JavaScript, no dependencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Interactive Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install
```

This will:
- Detect your git setup (including worktrees and custom hooks)
- Find existing hook managers (Husky, pre-commit, etc.)
- Detect AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Let you choose where to install Vow
- Uses AGENT_VOW.md for rules (local if exists, otherwise from package)

### Non-Interactive Installation

```bash
# Auto-detect and install everywhere applicable
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --yes

# Install only in specific locations
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --git     # Git hooks only
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --husky   # Husky only
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --claude  # Claude Code only
```

## 📖 How It Works

### The Flow

1. **AI attempts an action** (e.g., git commit)
2. **Vow intercepts** via configured hook
3. **Rules are displayed** from AGENT_VOW.md
4. **AI must self-assess** against each requirement
5. **Consent required** - AI creates `.AGENT_CONSENT` file with '1'
6. **Action proceeds** only after consent

### Technical Details

- **Hook Integration**: Vow installs as a git pre-commit hook or similar
- **Exit Codes**: Returns 1 (block) if no consent, 0 (allow) if consent given
- **Consent File**: `.AGENT_CONSENT` file created to indicate consent
- **Auto-cleanup**: Consent file is removed after check
- **Rules Source**: Uses local AGENT_VOW.md if exists, otherwise uses package's AGENT_VOW.md

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Git Commit Hooks
Prevent AI from committing without review. [Learn more about Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks):

**Automatic Installation** (Recommended):
```bash
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --git
```

**Manual Installation**:
```bash
# Add this one-liner to your existing pre-commit hook:
npx @probelabs/vow@latest check || exit 1

# Or for Husky v9 (recommended): https://typicode.github.io/husky/
npx husky init
echo 'npx @probelabs/vow@latest check' >> .husky/pre-commit
```

### Claude Code Integration
Vow automatically configures Claude Code settings with intelligent scope selection. [Learn more about Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/configuring#hooks):

```bash
# Interactive installation with scope choice
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install

# Choose between:
# • Local (settings.local.json) - affects only your user account
# • Project (settings.json) - affects all users of this project
```

**Manual Configuration:**

```json
// .claude/settings.local.json or .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "if echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | jq -r '.command' | grep -q '^git commit'; then npx @probelabs/vow@latest check; fi"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx @probelabs/vow@latest check"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx @probelabs/vow@latest check"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom Triggers
Use in any workflow where AI accountability matters:

```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
npx @probelabs/vow@latest check || exit 1
```

## 📝 Custom Vows

Vow works out of the box with built-in defaults, but you can customize the accountability rules for your specific project needs.

### View Current Rules

See what rules are currently active (local AGENT_VOW.md or package default):

```bash
npx @probelabs/vow@latest rules
```

### Create Custom Rules

**Step 1: Generate starting template**
```bash
# Export current rules to a file as your starting point
npx @probelabs/vow@latest rules > AGENT_VOW.md
```

**Step 2: Customize the rules**
Edit `AGENT_VOW.md` to add your project-specific requirements:

```markdown
# AGENT TASK COMPLETION CONSENT

Before finishing this task, you must honestly review your work.
**Do not lie** - if any items below are not true, fix it.

## TASK ADHERENCE
- ✓ I have followed the task exactly
- ✓ I have not cut corners or taken shortcuts

## CODE QUALITY (if code was modified)
- ✓ The code builds successfully without errors
- ✓ All tests pass and new tests are added where needed

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES
- ✓ I have updated the changelog with my changes
- ✓ Documentation reflects the new functionality
- ✓ No sensitive API keys or credentials are exposed
- ✓ Code follows the project's style guide
- ✓ I have tested the changes in staging environment

---

**If you agree with all above**, create consent file:
\`\`\`bash
printf '1' | tee .AGENT_CONSENT >/dev/null
\`\`\`
```

**Step 3: Test your custom rules**
```bash
# Test that your custom rules work
git commit --allow-empty -m "test custom rules"
```

### Reset to Defaults

Remove your custom rules to return to built-in defaults:

```bash
rm AGENT_VOW.md
npx @probelabs/vow@latest check  # Now uses built-in defaults again
```

## 🏛️ Philosophy

> *"Examine yourself without mercy."*  
> *"Accept your duty as given."*  
> *"Let your work speak truth."*  
> *"Embrace failure as teacher."*

Vow brings stoic principles to AI development. It's not about controlling AI—it's about AI learning to control itself through honest self-reflection.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Git Worktrees

Vow intelligently handles git worktrees:

```bash
# In a worktree, Vow detects:
# - Main repository location
# - Worktree-specific configuration
# - Shared hooks directory

vow install  # Will offer options for worktree-only or main repo
```

### Claude Code Scope Selection

Vow offers flexible configuration for Claude Code users:

```bash
# Interactive installation shows scope options
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install

# When Claude Code is detected, you'll see:
# ❯ Local (settings.local.json)    [Affects only your user account]
#   Project (settings.json)        [Affects all users of this project]
```

**Scope Details:**
- **Local** (`.claude/settings.local.json`) - User-specific settings that don't affect other team members
- **Project** (`.claude/settings.json`) - Shared settings that apply to all project contributors
- **Default**: Local scope is recommended for individual accountability

### Custom Hooks Directory

If you use a custom hooks directory:

```bash
# Set custom hooks path
git config core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks

# Vow will detect and install there
vow install
```

### Dry Run Mode

Preview changes before installation:

```bash
npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --dry-run
# Shows what would be changed without modifying files
```

### Uninstalling

Remove Vow from all locations:

```bash
vow install --uninstall
# Cleanly removes Vow from git hooks, Husky, Claude Code, etc.
```

### Rules System

Vow uses AGENT_VOW.md for accountability rules. If no local `AGENT_VOW.md` exists in your project, the package's default AGENT_VOW.md is used automatically. This ensures AI accountability even in fresh clones.

```bash
# View current rules (local or package default)
npx @probelabs/vow@latest rules

# Create custom AGENT_VOW.md to override defaults
npx @probelabs/vow@latest rules > AGENT_VOW.md
# Then customize the generated file

# Remove local rules to use package defaults again
rm AGENT_VOW.md
npx @probelabs/vow@latest check  # Uses package's AGENT_VOW.md
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Vow not triggering in git hooks

1. Check if hooks are executable:
   ```bash
   ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
   # Should show executable permissions (x)
   ```

2. Verify Vow installation:
   ```bash
   npx @probelabs/vow@latest install --dry-run
   # Check detection results
   ```

3. For custom hooks directories:
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath
   # Ensure Vow is installed in the correct directory
   ```

### Worktree issues

If Vow isn't working in a worktree:

```bash
# Check worktree configuration
git worktree list

# Reinstall for the main repository
cd $(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/..
vow install
```

### Claude Code not detecting

Vow prioritizes `.claude/settings.local.json` over `.claude/settings.json`. Ensure your settings file exists and is valid JSON:

```bash
# Check local settings (user-specific)
cat .claude/settings.local.json | jq .

# Or check project settings (shared)
cat .claude/settings.json | jq .

# Reinstall with scope selection
vow install --claude --force
```

## 🔌 Compatibility

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **Git**: v2.0 or higher
- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux, Windows (with Git Bash)
- **Hook Managers**: Husky v4-v9, pre-commit, lefthook, simple-git-hooks
- **AI Tools**: Claude Code, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot
